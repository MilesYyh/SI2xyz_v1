# SI2xyz_v1
a very simple bash scripts for get the xyz in the support information. 

It is so confused that why put the coordinates into the SI(PDF format) rather than provide the xyz file directly.
# usage
bash SI2xyz_v1.sh file size

demo:
bash SI2xyz_v1.sh test.xyz 4

comment:
- file
  - is the file that you copy the xyz from the paper of the Supporting information
- size
  - is the length from the start to the z cooridantefor for a element in you file
  - for example: "4" with "C -15.61199700 29.80883400 18.85407900 "
